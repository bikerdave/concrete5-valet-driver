# Concrete5-Valet-Driver
This is a custom driver for [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet) so you can serve [concrete5](http://concrete5.org) sites.

## Compatibility

As Valet requires the use of PHP7, this driver *should* work for versions of concrete5 from 5.7.5.4+, including v8.

## Installation 

Once you've [installed Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet#installation), just move the driver to your `~/.config/valet/Drivers/*` directory

## Official Valet Documentation

Documentation for the Valet framework can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet).
